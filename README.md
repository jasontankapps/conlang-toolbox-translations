# Translation Guide

This contains a copy of the translation files for [Conlang Toolbox](https://www.github.com/jasontankapps/conlang-toolbox) for easy access. They are formatted as Typescript modules that export JSON objects compliant with [i18next](https://www.i18next.com/misc/json-format).

## PLURALITY

Some terms will end in `_one` or `_other`. They always have a `{{count}}` that can be used if needed.

>**dog_one** = 1 dog
>
>>`"There is {{count}} dog."`  
>>= "There is 1 dog."
>
>**dog_other** = 0 dogs, 2+ dogs, etc
>
>>`"There are {{count}} dogs."`  
>>= "There are 17 dogs."

Other languages may have their own plurality \_endings. Check your i18n specifications.

---

## CONTEXTS

Some terms may be used in a specific context. This app uses `filename`, `formal`, and `presentation` contexts.

### Normal

>**dogQuestion** = Normal use
>
>>`"dogQuestion": "Is this a dog?"`

### Filename

>**dogQuestion_filename** = Must consist of only characters safe to use in a filename (this is generally anything except the backslash `\`, slash `/`, colon `:`, asterisk `*`, question mark `?`, quotation mark `"`, greater-than sign `>`, less-than sign `<`, and vertical bar `|`).
>
>>`"dogQuestion_filename": "Is_this_a_dog"`

### Formal

>**dogQuestion_formal** = This is being used as a proper name or otherwise has importance. In English, this simply means Capitalizing Most Words.
>
>>`"dogQuestion_formal": "Is This a Dog?"`

### Presentation

>**dogQuestion_presentation** = This is a user-facing term that is "pointing" at...
>
>- important information
>- a text box
>- a selectable option
>- a toggleable option
>- or something similar
>
>In English, I add a colon on the end of the formal term.
>
>>`"dogQuestion_presentation": "Is This a Dog?:"`

**Note:** Some keys are always in `presentation` or `formal` context, even though they don't use the listed suffix. This will be noted in the key's description.

## Labels

These symbols indicate *where* in the app a message is used.

>🟥 :: Headers *(important text in the app, possibly placed in the toolbar)*
>
>> Text headers should be relatively short and are usually capitalized.
>
>🔴 :: Button or option text
>
>> Button text should be kept short
>
>🟨 :: Dialog box headers *(yes/no prompts, alerts, etc, are dialog boxes)*
>
>🟡 :: Dialog box messages
>
>> Dialog box text should be clear and concise. Dialog box headers should be kept reasonably short.
>
>**🟦x** :: "Toast" message that stays on screen for `x` seconds before disappearing on its own.
>
>>The average user should be able to read a toast message before `x` seconds have expired.
>>
>> For example, `🟦3.5` indicates a toast message that displays for three and a half seconds before disappearing. A message like *"Good job!"* would be appropriate, but *"Good job! Your next task is to read 30 pages of Hemmigway's biography and prepare a 2-page essay on what you've learned. The paper should be double-spaced in a font no smaller than 12pt."* would be far too long.
>
>🔵 :: ARIA labels *(accessibility messages, not visible to the average user)*

Keys without any of these labels are only shown on-screen in plain text.

  "Originally assembled by Morris Swadesh, this list of concepts was chosen for their universal, culturally independent availability in as many languages as possible. However, he relied more on his intuition than on a rigorous set of criteria. **$t(Swadesh100)** is his final list from 1971. The **$t(Swadesh207)** is adapted from his original list from 1952. **$t(SwadeshYakhontov)** is a subset of the 207 assembled by Sergei Yakhontov. And the **$t(SwadeshWoodward) Sign List** was assembled by James Woodward to take into account the ways sign languages behave.",

  "## $t(Dolgopolsky) List",

  "",
  "## $t(LeipzigJakarta) List",
  "",
  "Similar to the Dolgopolsky list, this is a list of words judged to be the most resistant to borrowing. Experts on 41 languages from across the world were given a uniform vocabulary list and asked to provide the words for each item in the language on which they were an expert, as well as information on how strong the evidence that each word was borrowed was. The 100 concepts that were found in most languages and were most resistant to borrowing formed the Leipzig-Jakarta list.",

  "## $t(Landau200)",
  "",
  "The **Basic 200 List** is a subset of the **Landau Core Vocabulary (LCV)** developed by James Landau. It is Part I of the entire LCV. This list consists of 200 basic concepts that basically all anthropic cultures will have and have words for. This list makes many semantic distinctions that are not made in English (e.g \"leaf (on plant)\" vs. \"leaf (fallen off)\"), and some that are not made in any \"Standard Average European\" language (e.g. \"river (flowing into the sea)\" vs. \"river (flowing into another river)\")."

### cases

The `cases` object is an array of objects. Each object has a `header` property (a string), a `content` property (an array, described below), and an optional `extended` property (an array, same contents as `content`).

The `content` and `extended` properties are an array of either strings or arrays with exactly two strings.

The `header` is presented to the user, along with the items in the content property. (Items that are arrays only show the first string.) Tapping on an item will add it to the user's input, along with a single space. (Items that are array will add the second string instead of a space.)

The `extended` items will be hidden; the user can toggle to see them, At which point they appear the same way as `content` items.

```javascript
[
  {  
    header: "Modifiers",  
    content: [ [ "non-", "" ], [ "high-", "" ], [ "low-", "" ], "formal", "diminutive", "augmentative", "emphatic" ]  
  },
  {  
    header: "Number",  
    content: [ "singular", "plural", "dual", "trial", "paucal", "definite", "indefinite" ]  
  },
  {  
    header: "Noun Case",  
    content: [ "male", "female", "neuter", "animate", "inanimate" ]  
  },
  {  
    header: "Grammatical Case",  
    content: [ "nominative", "accusative", "genitive", "dative", "ablative", "instrumental", "locative" ],  
    extended: [ "vocative", "ergative", "absolutive", "partitive", "abessive", "adessive", "allative", "benefactive", "causal", "comitative", "delative", "distributive", "elative", "essive", "illative", "inessive", "instructive", "interrogative", "semblative", "sociative", "sublative", "superessive", "temporal", "terminative", "translative", "proximal", "relative", "adverbial", "oblique", "prepositional" ]  
  },
  {  
    header: "Person",  
    content: [ "1st-person", "2nd-person", "3rd-person", "1s", "1pl", "2s", "2pl", "3s", "3pl" ]  
  },
  {  
    header: "Tense",  
    content: [ "past", "present", "future" ]  
  },
  {  
    header: "Aspect",  
    content: [ "perfective", "imperfective", "perfect", "continuative", "progressive" ],  
    extended: [ "pluperfect", "habitual", "punctual", "iterative", "completive", "inceptive", "atelic", "telic", "static" ]  
  },
  {  
    header: "Mode",  
    content: [ "realis", "irrealis", "conditional", "subjunctive", "interrogative" ],  
    extended: [ "optative", "deontic", "hypothetical", "imaginary", "potential", "evidentiality", "validationality", "mirativity" ]  
  },
  {  
    header: "Valence",  
    content: [ "causative", "applicative", "reflexive", "reciprocal", "passive", "inverse", "anticausative", "antipassive" ]  
  }
],
```

### info

The `info` object has several properties. Most are arrays of strings in Markdown format, but one is special.

#### info.input

```javascript
[
  "This tab has one purpose: determining which words you want to decline or conjugate. Using this tab is entirely optional.",
  "",
  "The easiest way is to copy-paste a list of words, each on a line by itself. Or, you can use the **Import From Lexicon** button to pull in words stored in the **$t(common:Lexicon)**.",
  "",
  "Use the **$t(common:Input)** button to empty all words from $t(common:Input)."
]
```

#### info.groups

`` `DRAG HANDLE` `` (or any other text inside backticks) will be replaced with the drag handle icon.

```javascript
[
  "This is where you define groups of declensions and conjugations. Most languages treat certain groupings of words differently when they are declined or conjugated. For instance, English only declines its pronouns for case and person while Spanish has different conjugations for verbs depending on if they end in -ar, -er, or -ir.",
  "",
  "Click the (+) button to add a new Group. When you make a Group, you must give it a title or description. You can choose to label this as a _declension_, a _conjugation_ or under _other_ if you don't want to use those labels Optionally, you can note what types of words this Group will apply to.",
  "",
  "Next, you will provide instructions on how to find the \"$t(stem)\" of the word. For example, if you were creating a conjugation for words ending in -ar, you would put \"ar\" in the box labelled \"$t(RemoveFromEndOfWordToFindRoot)\".",
  "",
  "Note: You can provide multiple conditions. For instance, putting \"ar\" in both boxes will match words that begin with ar- _and_ end with -ar. You can also hit the \"$t(UseAdvancedMethod)\" toggle switch to use **regular expressions** to find a $t(stem). (See the end of this section for more info on regular expressions.)",
  "",
  "---",
  "",
  "At the end of the form, you will see an \"$t(common:AddNew)\" button. Use this to create the Group's individual declensions or conjugations. For simplicity, we will use the term \"method\" to mean either.",
  "",
  "First, you give the method a title. There is a small (+) button next to the input that will open a pop-up with numerous common declension and conjugation types, if you wish to use it.",
  "",
  "Below that is a toggle \"$t(UseEntireWord)\". If checked, the method will operate on the entire word instead of just the $t(stem).",
  "",
  "At the bottom, there are two input boxes around the word \"$t(stem)\". (This becomes \"$t(word)\" if you check the toggle above.) If this method would add a prefix, put the prefix in the box before \"$t(stem)\". If it would use a suffix, put it in the box after \"$t(stem)\". You can use both boxes for a circumfix but for infixes and other more complicated changes, you will need to use the \"advanced method\" and regular expressions.",
  "",
  "---",
  "",
  "Once your Groups are made, they will show up on the screen. Swipe left on them to find $t(common:Edit) and $t(common:Delete) buttons. You can also use the &#96;DRAG HANDLE&#96; drag handles to rearrange their order. (Note: you can't rearrange across types dragging a \"conjugation\" into the \"other\" or \"declension\" areas, for example. If you want to change its type, swipe left and choose the $t(common:Edit) button.)",
  "",
  "Here's an example of possible methods you could make for a Spanish-type conjugation:"
]
```

#### info.groupsExample

This is an array of two objects. Each object has a `title` property as a header and a `content` property that is an array of strings in Markdown format.

```javascript
[
  //This first object describe a Declenjugation group.
  {
    title: "Group",
    content: [
      "- **$t(common:Title)**: Conjugations (A)",
      "- **Type**: _conjugation_",
      "- **Remove from Start of Word**: (blank)",
      "- **Remove from End of Word**: ar",
    ],
  },
  //This second object describes a set of conjugations.
  {
    title: "Conjugations",
    content: [
      "- **1st-person singular present**: $t(stem)[o]",
      "- **2nd-person singular present**: $t(stem)[as]",
      "- **3rd-person singular present**: $t(stem)[a]",
      "- **1st-person plural present**: $t(stem)[amos]",
      "- **3rd-person plural present**: $t(stem)[an]",
    ],
  }
]
```

#### info.output

```javascript
[
  "This is where you can find the results of your work. At the top of the page, you can choose how you want the information to display, and choose if you want to display declensions conjugations, and/or other. If you want to decline/conjugate words you put in the **$t(common:Input)** tab be sure to switch the toggle on. It will open up a new set of options you can use to fine-tune the results.",
  "",
  "Click on $t(common:Generate) to display your info, or click on $t(Export) to export your info to a file. **Note**: when displaying a chart in the app, it may clip off the edge of the screen. If this happens, you can drag the chart left and right to scroll the hidden areas into view."
]
```

#### info.overview

```javascript
[
  "This tool is for creating **declensions** and **conjugations**.",
  "",
  "A declension is, at its most basic, modifying a word to show its role in a sentence. $t(Declensions) may apply to nouns pronouns, adjectives, adverbs, and articles to indicate number (singular, dual, plural, etc), case (nominative accusative, genitive, dative, etc), gender (male, female inanimate, etc), and other grammatical categories. ",
  "",
  "A conjugation is much like a declension, but it modifies verbs. Like declensions, they can indicate number gender, and case, but they also often include person (I, you they, etc), tense (past, present, future, etc), aspect (perfect, imperfect, etc), mood/mode, politeness, and numerous other verb qualities."
]

### info

The `info` key has multiple subkeys. All but one are arrays of strings in Markdown format.

#### info.input

```javascript
[
  "This tab has one purpose: determining which words you want to change.",
  "",
  "The easiest way is to copy-paste a list of words, each on a line by itself. Or, you can use the **Import from Lexicon** button to pull in words stored in the **$t(common:Lexicon)**.",
  "",
  "Use the **$t(common:Clear)** button to empty all words from $t(common:Input)."
],
```

### info.charGroups

```javascript
[
  "This is where you define groups of characters representing sounds. You can reference these character groups in **Transformations** and **Sound Changes** to fine-tune the way your language evolves.",
  "",
  "Click the (+) button to add a new character group. When you make a character group, you must give it a _description_ and a one-character _label_. The description is for your own benefit, while the label will be used to refer to this character group in the other tabs. The label can be any single character except for these: **^$()[]{}.*+?|**. The letters/characters in your character group are called a _run_."
],
```

### info.transformations

Words placed in `` `backticks` `` will be replaced with the icon for a drag hande

```javascript
[
  "There may be cases when you need to modify the input words before you evolve them. A common reason would be to turn a group of characters (such as \"sh\", \"th\", or \"ng\" in English) into a single character that can be targeted more easily.",
  "",
  "When you make a new _transformation_, you provide an _input expression_, a _transformation direction_, an _output expression_, and, optionally, a _transformation description_ for your own benefit.",
  "",
  "The _transformation direction_ is either \"At input then undo at output\", \"At input and at output\", \"At input only\", or \"At output only\", and they determine how the two expressions are used.",
  "",
  "**At input only:** Before anything else happens, input words are searched, and any instances of the _input expression_ are replaced with the _output expression_. **Regular expressions** (see the **Sound Changes Tab**'s help section) and %Group references are allowed in the _input expression_ only. (A %Group reference is something like **%G** to indicate any character in character group G's run, or **!%G** to indicate any character _not_ in that run.)",
  "",
  "**At output only:** After all **sound changes** are processed, any instances of the _input expression_ are replaced with the _output expression_. Regular expressions and %Group references are allowed in the _input expression_ only.",
  "",
  "**At input then undo at output:** Before anything else happens, input words are searched, and any instances of the _input expression_ are replaced with the _output expression_. After all **sound changes** are processed, any instances of the _output expression_ are replaced with the _input expression_.",
  "",
  "Regular expressions are not allowed, but non-negative %Group references are allowed if and only if both input and output have them. In that case, something special happens: when the transformation matches a character in a character group, it will note what position that character is in the character group's run. It will then look at the other expression's character group and pick out the character in the same position.",
  "",
  "For example: If %S is being replaced with %Z, and those character groups have runs \"ptk\" and \"bdg\", \"p\" will be replaced with \"b\", \"t\" will be replaced with \"d\", and \"k\" will be replaced by \"g\". If the first character group has more letters than the second, the second character group's run will be repeated until it's long enough to find a match.",
  "",
  "NOTE: If you have unequal numbers of %Group references in the search and replacement expressions, errors may occur.",
  "",
  "**At input and at output:** As _At input then undo at output_, but the _input expression_ is replaced with the _output expression_ before AND after the **sound changes** are processed.",
  "",
  "Click the (+) button to add a new transformation. The first transformation in the list will be run first, the second transformation second, and so on down the list. This may cause unintended effects as previous transformations mutate the original word, so you can reorganize your transformations by using the `DRAG HANDLE` drag handles."
],
```

### info.soundChangesBlocks

This object defines `BlockFormat` objects that will be inserted into the text as specially-formatted HTML blocks.

The tables will have "important" text enclosed in a box, and "unimportant" text linking the boxes together.

Each object will have an optional `arrow` property (defaults to `"-&gt;"`), an optional `serif` property that changes the font to a serif font (defaults to `false`).

Each object chooses **one** of the following sets of properties to add.

1. **simple**: an array of strings in the format `important, uninmportant, important...`
2. **reversed**: an array of strings in the format `unimportant, important, unimportant...`
3. Three properties:
     - **important**: a string that marks the boundaries of "important" info (defaults to `"!"`)
     - **unimportant**: a string that marks the boundaries of "unimportant" info (defaults to `"$"`)
     - **complex**: an array of strings, each formatted as `"Some !important! and $unimportant$ stuff with regular stuff mixed in."`

You probably don't need to translate these or modify them in any way. They just express certain linguistic concepts. The arrow *may* need adjusting if your target language is RtL.

```javascript
{
  block1: {
    arrow: "->",
    simple: ["s", "->", "z", "/", "d_", "!", "_h"]
  },
  block2: {
    arrow: "->",
    simple: ["s", "->", "z", "/", "#_"]
  },
},
```

Other `info` properties may access these bits on information by putting a block's name inside of `` `backticks` `` on a line by itself. Anything else put inside backticks will be replaced with the drag handle icon.

### info.soundChanges

```javascript
[
  "This is where you determine how your words evolve. The display follows basic standard phonological rules for describing sound changes:",
  "",
  "`block1`",
  "",
  "The above means that \"s\" changes to \"z\" after a \"d\", but not when it's before an \"h\".",
  "",
  "The first box is the _search expression_, the second is the _replacement expression_, the third is the _context expression_, and the last is the _exception expression_.",
  "",
  "The _search expression_ can include plain text or **regular expressions** (see the end of this section for more info). It can also contain %Group references. (A %Group reference is something like **%G** to indicate any character in character group C's run, or **!%G** to indicate any character that is _not_ in that run.)",
  "",
  "The _replacement expression_ should be plain text. However, it can include non-negative %Group references **if and only if** the _search expression_ does, too. In that case, something special happens: when the evolver matches a character in a character group, it will note what position that character is in the character group's run. It will then look at _replacement_ character group and pick out the character in the same position. For example: If %S is being replaced with %Z, and those character groups have runs \"ptk\" and \"bdg\", \"p\" will be replaced with \"b\", \"t\" will be replaced with \"d\", and \"k\" will be replaced by \"g\". (If the first character group has more letters than the second, the second character group's run will be repeated until it's long enough to find a match.) **NOTE:** If you have unequal numbers of %Group references in the _search expression_ and _replacement expression_, errors may occur.",
  "",
  "The _context expression_ describes where in the word the _search expression_ must be before it can be changed into the _replacement expression_. The _exception expression_ is similar, but it describes where in the world a match **can't** be made. (The _exception expression_ is optional.)",
  "",
  "There are two characters in a _context expression_ and _exception expression_ that have special functions. The underscore **_** represents where the _replacement expression_ is being matched. You **must** include an underscore. The hash symbol **#** represents the beginning or end of a word. For example: if you want to turn \"s\" into \"z\" at the beginning of a word, you could create the following:",
  "",

### info

The `info` key has multiple subkeys. Most are arrays of strings in Markdown format.

This information is presented in help screens on the main WG subpages, as well as the WordGen Overview page.

#### info.charGroupExample

This is a block of text representing a set of Character Groups. It can be used in the next key and the `syllablesStartIsOverview` key.

```javascript
[
  "I=pbk",
  "L=lr",
  "C=pbklr",
  "V=eioau"
]
```

#### info.charGroups

Put `` `example` `` in backticks to insert `info.charGroupExample` as a block.

Putting `` `anything else` `` inside backticks will display "anything else" as visually emphasized text, indicating it is in International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) format.

```javascript
[
  "This is where you define groups of sounds. The two simplest groupings are _consonants_ and _vowels_, but you may want to create multiple character groups depending on how you want your language's syllables formed. For example, the consonants `pbk` in English may be followed by the consonants `lr` at the beginning of syllables. So you might choose them as character groups, while also putting `pbklr` in a third character group for general consonants.",
  "",
  "Click the (+) button to add a new character group. When you make a character group, you must give it a _description_ and a one-character _label_. The label can be any single character except for these: **^$\\()[]{}.*+?|**. The description is for your own benefit, while the label will be used to refer to this character group in the **Syllables** tab. So you may end up with character groups that look like the following:",
  "",
  "`example`",
  "",
  "The letters/characters in your character group are called a _run_. The run should be put in a specific order. The first letter is more likely to be used than the second, the second more likely than the third, and so on. This is designed to mimic natural languages, which tend to use certain sounds more than others. You can adjust this _dropoff rate_, or eliminate it entirely, on the **$t(common:Settings)** tab."
]
```

#### info.charGroupsIsOverview

This section is only printed on the Overview page, not the Character Group help page.

```javascript
[
  "**Character group run dropoff** is explained in the **$t(common:Settings)** section below."
],
```

#### info.charGroupsNotOverview

This section is printed on the Character Group help page, not the Overview page.

```javascript
[
  "**Character group run dropoff** ranges from 0 to 50. At zero (flat), character group choices are all equiprobable. Otherwise, the higher the number, the more likely it is that the first characters in the character group are used. See the help section on the **$t(common:Settings)** page for more information."
],
```

#### info.syllablesStartIsOverview

This section begins the Syllables section in the Overview, and is not shown on the Syllables help page.

Put `` `charGroup example` `` in backticks to insert `info.charGroupExample` as a block.

Putting anything else inside backticks will be ignored and not display.

```javascript
[
  "This is where you determine how your syllables are formed. You use the _labels_ to describe the elements that make up a syllable.",
  "",
  "For example, using the character groups in the previous section, you could decide to make a list of syllables that looks like this:",
  "",
  "`charGroup example`",
  "",
  "...you could decide to make a list of syllables such as the following:"
],
```

#### info.syllablesStartIsOverview

This section is the beginning of the Syllables help page, and not shown on the Overview page.

```javascript
[
  "This is where you determine how your syllables are formed. You use the _labels_ to describe the elements that make up a syllable. For example, using the character groups in the previous section, you could decide to make a list of syllables such as the following:"
],
```

#### info.syllablesExample

This is a block of text representing a set of Syllables. It can be used in the next key.

```javascript
[
  "ILV",
  "CV",
  "ILVC"
],
```

#### info.syllables

This is the main block of text for the Syllables section in both Overview and the Syllables help page.

```javascript
[
  "The above can generate syllables such as _pla_, _ku_, or _brep_, which could then be combined into words such as _plabrep_ or _kupla_. You can also put characters in a syllable that don't correspond to a character group: **sILV** could generate syllables such as _sbra_ or _spli_.",
  "",
  "If you desire a greater amount of control over your words, you can turn on the **Use multiple syllable types** toggle. This will show you four separate boxes, each with a different role in a word: **single-word syllables** are used exclusively for one-syllable words, **word-initial syllables** are only used at the start of a word, **word-final syllables** are only used at the end of a word, and **mid-word syllables** fill out the middle of words when needed.",
  "",
  "The order of syllables in each box makes a difference. The first syllable listed is more likely to be used than the second, the second more likely than the third, and so on. You can adjust this _dropoff rate_, or eliminate it entirely, on the **$t(common:Settings)** tab. You'll also find options there to determine how often one-syllable words are generated, and put an upper limit on the number of syllables any one word can have."
],
```

#### info.syllablesEndIsOverview

This section ends the Syllables section in the Overview, and is not shown on the Syllables help page.

```javascript
[
  "The **Syllable box dropoff** is explained in the **$t(common:Settings)** section below."
],
```

#### info.syllablesEnd

This section is the end of the Syllables help page, and not shown on the Overview page.

```javascript
[
  "The **Syllable box dropoff** ranges from 0 to 50. At zero (flat), syllable choices are all equiprobable. Otherwise, the higher the number, the more likely it is that the first lines in the box are used. See the help section on the **$t(common:Settings)** page for more information."
],
```

#### info.transBlocks

This object uses `BlockFormat` objects, as described in [WordEvolve's info.soundChangesBlocks](#infosoundchangesblocks)

Insert a formatted block into the text with `` `nameOfBlock` `` inside backticks.

```javascript
{
  block1: {

#### info.trans

This section describes the Transformations tool inside the Overview and the Transformations help page.

Use `` `DRAG HANDLE` `` inside of backticks to insert the drag handle icon into the text.

```javascript
[
  "There may be cases when you need to fine-tune the words that get generated on the **Output Tab**. A common reason would be to turn a specific character into two or three letters. You may create a group such as **C=pbkClrS**, using capital letters in place of sounds like _\"ch\"_ or _\"sh\"_. This could generate syllables like _Cu_ or _pliS_.",
  "",
  "When you make a new _transformation_, you provide a _$t(wgwe:searchExpression)_, a _$t(wgwe:replacementExpression)_, and, optionally, a _transformation description_ for your own benefit.",
  "",
  "Both expressions can use **regular expressions** (an explanation can be found at the end of this section). You can also use the special expression %X to indicate any character in group X's run, or !%X to indicate any character _not_ in that run. (e.g, If _X=abc_, then %X will be treated as if it was the regular expression _[abc]_.)",
  "",
  "So, you could make a $t(wgwe:searchExpression) **C** with a $t(wgwe:replacementExpression) **ch**, which will result in _Cu_ above becoming _chu_. This will result in a transformation that looks like the following:",
  "",
  "`block1`",
  "",
  "Click the (+) button to add a new transformation. The first transformation in the list will be run first, the second transformation second, and so on down the list. This may cause unintended effects as previous transformations mutate the original word, so you can reorganize your transformations by using the `DRAG HANDLE` drag handles.",
  "",
  "---",
  "",
  "Here are some sample transformations for some linguistic phenomina:",
  "- Consonant harmony: `block2`",
  "- Liquid dissimilation: `block3`",
  "- Synchronic epenthesis: `block4`",
  "- Anticipatory assimilation: `block5`"

```

#### info.outputMain

This section describes the "Main" part of the Output page. It's used in the Overview and Output help page.

```javascript
[
  "This is where the magic happens. Click the **Generate** button and your output will appear. Press the button again and a new set of output will replace it."
]
```

#### info.outputSettings

This section describes the "Settings" part of the Output page. It's used in the Overview and Output help page.

```javascript
[
  "Click on the gear icon to open a list of options. The first is a drop-down menu where you can select what to output. The choices are **Pseudo-text**, **Wordlist** and **All possible syllables**.",
  "",
  "The **Pseudo-text** will create words and put them into sentences, making a block of text you might find in a book. You can determine how many sentences are made by adjusting the **Number of sentences** slider.",
  "",
  "The **Wordlist** outputs a list of words devoid of context. You can choose a number of options to modify this list. **Capitalize words** will capitalize every word. **Sort output** will alphabetize the list, and **Multi-column layout** will arrange the list in multiple columns instead of one long column. At the bottom, there is a **Wordlist size** slider that controls how many words are generated.",
  "",
  "**All possible syllables**, as you might guess, outputs a list of every possible syllable your character groups, syllables and transformations allow. The _Capitalize words_, _Sort output_ and _Multi-column layout_ options above will also work on this syllable list.",
  "",
  "At the top of the settings, you can choose to **Show syllable breaks**, which will in·sert a dot be·tween eve·ry syl·la·ble in each word. While this option can be useful, please note that it will break any _transformations_ that try to work across syllable boundaries."
]
```

#### info.outputLexicon

This section describes the exporting-to-Lexicon part of the Output page. It's used in the Overview and Output help page.

```javascript
[
  "Once you've generated words, you can save them to the **$t(common:Lexicon)**. Click the book button and the generated words will light up. Tap on words you wish to save. When you've selected all the words you want, tap the book button again and you'll be given a pop-up where you can choose which **$t(common:Lexicon)** column to import them into."
]
```

#### info.settings

This section describes the Settings page. It's used in the Overview and Output help page.

```javascript
[
  "This final tab fine-tunes the output. These can make a huge difference in how your conlang appears.",
  "",
  "## The Buttons",
  "",
  "**Load Preset** brings up a menu where you can choose from several pre-loaded options. The initial settings when you first start the app are the _Simple_ preset. The others are offered to give you ideas of what's possible with the app. They will load _character groups_, _syllables_, _transformations_ and possibly change the remaining settings on this page, too.",
  "",
  "**Save/Load Custom Info** opens a dialog where you can save your own _character groups_, _syllables_, _transformations_ and the settings on this page. This allows you to switch between your own personal language settings.",
  "",
  "## The Settings",
  "",
  "**Rate of monosyllable words** determines how often a one-syllable word is created. It's a percentage from 0 (never) to 100 (always).",
  "",
  "**Maximum number of syllables per word** sets an upper limit on how long your words can grow.",
  "",
  "**Character group run dropoff** and **Syllable box dropoff** range from 0 to 50. At zero (flat), group and syllable choices are all equiprobable. Otherwise, the number becomes a percentage. The higher the number, the more likely it is that the first syllables or group characters are used. (This mimics natural languages, which tend to prefer certain sounds and patterns.) This is how it works:",
  "",
  "1. A random number is generated from 1 to 100.",
  "2. If the number is lower than the dropoff percentage, the first choice is picked.",
  "3. If not, the generator moves the first choice to the end of the line, then returns to step 1, generating a new number.",
  "4. This cycle continues until a number is generated that is equal to or greater than the dropoff percentage.",
  "",
  "The remaining options only apply to _Pseudo-texts_.",
  "",
  "**Capitalize sentences** determines if each sentence starts with a capital letter.",
  "",
  "The other options determine what your sentences look like. Three-fourths of all sentences will be _declarative_ (simple statements), one-sixth will be _interrogative_ (questions), and the remaining one-twelfth will be _exclamatory_ (excited utterances). You can put special punctuation before and after these sentences if you wish."
]
```

#### info.overview

This section is only used in the Overview. It displays at the top of the page before any of the tool sections.

Second-level numeric lists, like the "Sounds can be grouped like this:" sublist, will display as lowercase Roman numerals. That is why number 3 in the main list refers to (i), (iv), and the like.

```javascript
[
  "This tool is for attempting to generate new words based on rules you set up.",
  "",
  "WordGen makes two assumptions. First, that he basic unit of a \"word\" is a syllable, and second, that a \"syllable\" can be described as a combination of sounds that are spoken together.",
  "",
  "This is the most basic use case:",
  "",
  "1. Choose what sounds your language will have, and the characters (letters) that will represent these sounds.",
  "2. Separate these characters into groups, such as vowels and consonants.",
  "3. Decide the structure(s) of the syllables these sounds form.",
  "",
  "For example, a (very rough) approximation of Japanese might be:",
  "",
  "1. Uses the sounds k, g, s, z, t, d, n, h, b, p, m, y, r, w, a, i, u, e, and o.",
  "2. Sounds can be grouped like this:",
  "    1. k, g, s, z, t, d, n, h, b, p, m, r",
  "    2. a, i, u, e, o",
  "    3. y",
  "    4. a, u, o",
  "    5. w",
  "    6. a, o",
  "    7. n",
  "3. Syllables can be made from (i)+(ii), (iii)+(iv), (v)+(vi), (ii) by itself, and (vii) by itself.",
  "",
  "With that information, you can proceed into the rest of this tool:",
  "",
  "The **Character Groups** tab is for holding groups of sounds, and the **Syllables** tab describes how they fit together. For more complex words, the **Transformations** tab provides a way to tweak the generated output with search expressions and replacement expressions. The **Output Tab** is where the new words can be found, and the **$t(common:Settings)** tab has other options you can tweak if needed.",
  "",
  "Be sure to check out the _Presets_ over on the Settings tab. The \"Pseudo-Japanese\" preset shows one way to put the above info to use."
