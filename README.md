# Translation Guide

This contains a copy of the translation files for [Conlang Toolbox](https://www.github.com/jasontankapps/conlang-toolbox) for easy access. They are formatted as Typescript modules that export JSON objects compliant with [i18next](https://www.i18next.com/misc/json-format).

## PLURALITY

Some terms will end in `_one` or `_other`. They always have a `{{count}}` that can be used if needed.

>**dog_one** = 1 dog
>
>>`"There is {{count}} dog."`  
>>= "There is 1 dog."
>
>**dog_other** = 0 dogs, 2+ dogs, etc
>
>>`"There are {{count}} dogs."`  
>>= "There are 17 dogs."

Other languages may have their own plurality \_endings. Check your i18n specifications.

---

## CONTEXTS

Some terms may be used in a specific context. This app uses `filename`, `formal`, and `presentation` contexts.

### Normal

>**dogQuestion** = Normal use
>
>>`"dogQuestion": "Is this a dog?"`

### Filename

>**dog_filename** = Must consist of only characters safe to use in a filename (this is generally anything except the backslash `\`, slash `/`, colon `:`, asterisk `*`, question mark `?`, quotation mark `"`, greater-than sign `>`, less-than sign `<`, and vertical bar `|`).
>
>>`"dogQuestion_filename": "Is_this_a_dog"`

### Formal

>**dog_formal** = This is being used as a proper name or otherwise has importance. In English, this simply means Capitalizing Most Words.
>
>>`"dogQuestion_formal": "Is This a Dog?"`

### Presentation

>**dog_presentation** = This is a user-facing term that is "pointing" at...
>
>- important information
>- a text box
>- a selectable option
>- a toggleable option
>- or something similar
>
>In English, I add a colon on the end of the formal term.
>
>>`"dogQuestion_presentation": "Is This a Dog?:"`

**Note:** Some keys are always in `presentation` context, even though they don't use the `_presentation` suffix. This will be noted in its description.

## Labels

These symbols indicate *where* in the app a message is used.

>🟥 :: Headers *(important text in the app, possibly placed in the toolbar)*
>
>> Text headers should be relatively short and are usually capitalized.
>
>🔴 :: Button or option text
>
>> Button text should be kept short
>
>🟨 :: Dialog box headers *(yes/no prompts, alerts, etc, are dialog boxes)*
>
>🟡 :: Dialog box messages
>
>> Dialog box text should be clear and concise. Dialog box headers should be kept reasonably short.
>
>**🟦x** :: "Toast" message that stays on screen for `x` seconds before disappearing on its own.
>
>>The average user should be able to read a toast message before `x` seconds have expired.
>>
>> For example, `🟦3.5` indicates a toast message that displays for three and a half seconds before disappearing. A message like *"Good job!"* would be appropriate, but *"Good job! Your next task is to read 30 pages of Hemmigway's biography and prepare a 2-page essay on what you've learned. The paper should be double-spaced in a font no smaller than 12pt."* would be far too long.
>
>🔵 :: ARIA labels *(accessibility messages, not visible to the average user)*

Keys without any of these notes are only shown on-screen in plain text.

### cases

The `cases` object is an array of objects. Each object has a `header` property (a string), a `content` property (an array, described below), and an optional `extended` property (an array, same contents as `content`).

The `content` and `extended` properties are an array of either strings or arrays with exactly two strings.

The `header` is presented to the user, along with the items in the content property. (Items that are arrays only show the first string.) Tapping on an item will add it to the user's input, along with a single space. (Items that are array will add the second string instead of a space.)

The `extended` items will be hidden; the user can toggle to see them, At which point they appear the same way as `content` items.

### info

The `info` object has several properties. Most are arrays of strings in Markdown format, but one is special.

#### info.input

>\[  
>"This tab has one purpose: determining which words you want to decline or conjugate. Using this tab is entirely optional.",  
>"",  
>"The easiest way is to copy-paste a list of words, each on a line by itself. Or, you can use the \*\*Import From Lexicon\*\* button to pull in words stored in the \*\*$t(common:Lexicon)\*\*.",  
>"",  
>"Use the \*\*$t(common:Input)\*\* button to empty all words from $t(common:Input).",  
>\]

#### info.groups

`` `DRAG HANDLE` `` (or any other text inside backticks) will be replaced with the drag handle icon.

>\[  
>"This is where you define groups of declensions and conjugations. Most languages treat certain groupings of words differently when they are declined or conjugated. For instance, English only declines its pronouns for case and person while Spanish has different conjugations for verbs depending on if they end in -ar, -er, or -ir.",  
>"",  
>"Click the (+) button to add a new Group. When you make a Group, you must give it a title or description. You can choose to label this as a \_declension\_, a \_conjugation\_ or under \_other\_ if you don't want to use those labels Optionally, you can note what types of words this Group will apply to.",  
>"",  
>"Next, you will provide instructions on how to find the \"$t(stem)\" of the word. For example, if you were creating a conjugation for words ending in -ar, you would put \"ar\" in the box labelled \"$t(RemoveFromEndOfWordToFindRoot)\".",  
>"",  
>"Note: You can provide multiple conditions. For instance, putting \"ar\" in both boxes will match words that begin with ar- \_and\_ end with -ar.

>"Once your Groups are made, they will show up on the screen. Swipe left on them to find $t(common:Edit) and $t(common:Delete) buttons.

#### info.groupsExample

This is an array of two objects. Each object has a `title` property as a header and a `content` property that is an array of strings in Markdown format.

>\[

This first object describe a Declenjugation group.

>>{  
>>**title:** "Group",  
>>**content:** [ "- \*\*$t(common:Title)\*\*: Conjugations (A)", "- \*\*Type\*\*: \_conjugation\_", "- \*\*Remove from Start of Word\*\*: (blank)", "- \*\*Remove from End of Word\*\*: ar", ],  
>>},

This second object describes a set of conjugations.

>>{  
>>**title:** "Conjugations",  
>>**content:** [ "- \*\*1st-person singular present\*\*: $t\(stem\)\[o\]", "- \*\*2nd-person singular present\*\*: $t\(stem\)\[as\]", "- \*\*3rd-person singular present\*\*: $t\(stem\)\[a\]", "- \*\*1st-person plural present\*\*: $t\(stem\)\[amos\]", "- \*\*3rd-person plural present\*\*: $t\(stem\)\[an\]", ],  
>>}
>
>\]

#### info.output

>\[  
>"This is where you can find the results of your work. At the top of the page, you can choose how you want the information to display, and choose if you want to display declensions conjugations, and/or other. If you want to decline/conjugate words you put in the \*\*$t(common:Input)\*\* tab be sure to switch the toggle on. It will open up a new set of options you can use to fine-tune the results.",  
>"",  
>"Click on $t(common:Generate) to display your info, or click on $t(Export) to export your info to a file. \*\*Note\*\*: when displaying a chart in the app, it may clip off the edge of the screen. If this happens, you can drag the chart left and right to scroll the hidden areas into view.",

#### info.overview

>\[  
>"This tool is for creating \*\*declensions\*\* and \*\*conjugations\*\*.",  
>"",  
>"A declension is, at its most basic, modifying a word to show its role in a sentence. $t(Declensions) may apply to nouns pronouns, adjectives, adverbs, and articles to indicate number (singular, dual, plural, etc), case (nominative accusative, genitive, dative, etc), gender (male, female inanimate, etc), and other grammatical categories. ",  
>"",  
>"A conjugation is much like a declension, but it modifies verbs. Like declensions, they can indicate number gender, and case, but they also often include person (I, you they, etc), tense (past, present, future, etc), aspect (perfect, imperfect, etc), mood/mode, politeness, and numerous other verb qualities.",
