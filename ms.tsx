	// INFORMATIONAL KEYS
	//   This is where you'll find the jargon-heavy explanation of
	//      linguistics that is the essence of MorphoSyntax. Please be sure
	//      to use the proper linguistic terms of your localization!

	// Keys that begin with "title", "label" and "info" are linked. They are
	//    used to create the information pop-ups that appear throughout
	//    MorphoSyntax.
	//
	// Keys that begin with "title" will be used as the header of the
	//    pop-up.
	//
	// Keys that begin with "label" will be used as the text of the buttons
	//    that launch the pop-ups. These keys are OPTIONAL: If a "title" and
	//    "info" are missing a corresponding "label" key, then the button will
	//    use the text provided in the "genericInfoButtonText" key above.
	//
	// Keys that begin with "label" need not be translated directly. You can
	//    change them to whatever you think works best for your localization,
	//    or omit them entirely. (Many of the "label" keys are English puns or
	//    other quirky phrases that will not translate well!)
	//
	// Keys that begin with "info" are arrays that use Markdown formatting.
	//    They should be kept in a nested-list format. Please translate the
	//    basic information as carefully as you can. They will often contain
	//    examples from English or other languages. You may omit the examples,
	//    or change them to an example that is better understood by your
	//    target audience.
	//
	// "Info" keys may also contain "Translation Tables", which are a special
	//    format used by the app. They will be in a format like the following:
	//
	//    `[translationTable] Le | cortó | el | pelo. || 3.DAT | cut.3s.PST | DEF.M.s | hair ||| Optional final line.`
	//
	//    It is important to keep the following:
	//       1) The indentation of the line (it should match the list item
	//          it is a part of)
	//       2) The surrounding `backticks`
	//       3) The exact text "[translationTable]" at the beginning
	//       4) The entire table MUST remain in a single string, not spread
	//          among multiple strings
	//
	//    The format follows this pattern:
	//       1) table cells in a row separated by single pipes: |
	//       2) table rows separated by double pipes: ||
	//       3) an optional final row, not broken into cells, separated by
	//          three pipes: |||
	//       4) pipes must have at least one space on either side, e.g.
	//          "this is || ok", "this is||not ok"
	//
	//    Except for the optional final row, table rows should have an equal
	//       number of cells. The odd rows will be an example, while the even
	//       rows will be the cell-by-cell translation of the given example.
	//       These translations use Leipzig Glossing rules. I am unsure how
	//       universal these rules are, or if they have localized forms in
	//       other languages. You can learn about these rules here:
	//       https://www.eva.mpg.de/lingua/resources/glossing-rules.php
	//
	//    The cells and rows may contain simple Markdown formatting, but NOT
	//       table formatting.

	// Keys that begin with "checkbox" will have other properties. Only
	//    translate the plain text within them. DO NOT change the format
	//    of the information. E.g, if a property is an array of three strings,
	//    the translated property MUST also be an array of three strings.
	//
	// Keys that begin with "checkbox" and DO NOT end with "Export" will
	//    have a "labels" property, and may have a "header" and/or
	//    "columnHeaders" properties. The "labels" property will be an array
	//    of strings, or an array of arrays of strings. The "columnHeaders"
	//    property will be an array of strings. The "header" property will be
	//    a single string. Each individual string in these properties can use
	//    Markdown formatting.
	//
	// Keys that begin with "checkbox" and DO end with "Export" also have
	//    "labels" and "header" properties, but are PLAIN TEXT ONLY.

	// Keys with a "_percentage" context are used in docx/text exports only.
	//
	// Keys with a "_percentageMarkdown" context are used in Markdown text
	//    exports, and may use Markdown formatting.

	// Keys that begin with "text" are prompts that appear before open text
	//    boxes the user can write in.


	// HTML in Markdown is DISABLED and should not be used.

	// In MorphoSyntax ONLY, GitHub Flavored Markdown format is supported.
	//    This allows for things like tables and strike-throughs. You can
	//    learn more about the format here: https://github.github.com/gfm/
