# Concepts : the master list of concepts

Many of the keys in this section contain punctuation and spaces, so they must be enclosed in quotation marks.

When translating this, be sure not to be ambiguous. If there are multiple meanings or interpretations for a given word, add clarifications in parantheses. For example, "bite" can be a verb or noun in English, but this list only contains the verb form, so it is presented as "bite (verb)".
